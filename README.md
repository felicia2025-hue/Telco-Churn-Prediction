# Telco Churn Prediction

## About this project
This project develops a machine learning model to identify telco customers most likely to churn using the Telco Q3 California dataset (7,043 customers). The dataset indicates which customers have left, stayed, or signed up, enabling the model to learn churn patterns and flag high-risk customers before they leave. For deployment, the model uses a lean Top-10 feature set, enabling fast, reliable predictions in real-time workflows.
